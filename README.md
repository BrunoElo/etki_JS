# etki_JS Remote Code Camp

Together with [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) and [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en), we have organized etki_JS Remote Code Camp program, an online workshop series, to study and learn modern web development. 

In the course of etki_JS we will run regular co-learning workshops for supporting your efforts on learning on the structured course material we have selected, where you can ask your questions on the material to experienced software engineers, or discuss, study with peers. We will provide you with a communication channel.

etki_JS will be self-paced, 100% free of charges, and will run fully remote.

We will study the open-source programs of University of Helsinki's FullStackOpen, and material from FreeCodeCamp and Javascript.info. If you follow all the course material diligently for consequent months and finish the FullStackOpen program and deliver the projects in the course program, you will be presented a unique certificate from University of Helsinki. 

Main goal of this course is to provide a free & safe online learning possibility for the underrepresented and underprivileged people in technology field, and for the people who are looking into transitioning into technology area.
